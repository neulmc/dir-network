This is the source code of "Effective Microstructure Segmentation and Measurement Method Based on Uncertainty Estimation for Aluminum Alloy Metallographic Images". In this work, we introduce uncertainty estimation techniques to address the challenge of similar particle appearances and indistinct boundaries in metallographic images.
